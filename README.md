# ChatGPT Review Sentiment Analysis 🧠📊

This project explores how users perceive ChatGPT by performing sentiment analysis on user-submitted reviews. Using simple yet powerful NLP techniques, we analyze textual feedback to classify reviews into Positive, Negative, or Neutral categories.

## 💡 Problem Statement

With the growing popularity of ChatGPT and other generative AI tools, user reviews are piling up across platforms. But reading through hundreds or thousands of them manually isn't scalable. There’s a need to **automatically analyze and quantify user sentiment** to understand trends, highlight concerns, and spot areas of improvement.

## ✅ My Solution

This project uses **TextBlob**, a lightweight NLP tool, to extract **sentiment polarity scores** from reviews and classify them accordingly:

- Reviews with **positive polarity (> 0)** are labeled **Positive**
- Reviews with **negative polarity (< 0)** are labeled **Negative**
- Reviews with **zero polarity (== 0)** are labeled **Neutral**

The steps are simple and interpretable:
1. **Read in the reviews** from a dataset or online source
2. **Apply TextBlob sentiment analysis**
3. **Assign sentiment labels** based on polarity scores
4. **Visualize** the overall sentiment distribution

This provides a fast, easy-to-understand overview of public opinion on ChatGPT.

## 🧰 Tools & Libraries Used

- Python 3
- Pandas
- TextBlob (for sentiment analysis)
- Matplotlib / Seaborn (for plotting)
- Jupyter Notebook

---

## 📁 Project Structure

- `ChatGpt_Review_Analysis.ipynb` – Jupyter Notebook with all code, analysis, and visualizations
- `reviews.csv` *(optional)* – Review dataset (if stored locally)

---

## 📈 Output Example

After running the sentiment classifier, we get a distribution like:

Positive 320 Negative 100 Neutral 80 Name: Sentiment, dtype: int64


This helps stakeholders quickly gauge public opinion.

## 🧠 Suggestions for Improvement

While TextBlob is simple and beginner-friendly, it may not handle nuances like sarcasm, mixed sentiment, or complex sentence structures. Here are some ways to enhance this project:

- 🔄 **Replace TextBlob with advanced models** like [VADER](https://github.com/cjhutto/vaderSentiment) for social media-style text or transformer-based models such as **BERT** or **RoBERTa** for deeper contextual analysis.
- 🧵 **Incorporate topic modeling** (e.g., LDA or BERTopic) to discover key themes and topics users frequently mention in reviews.
- 🎭 **Add emotion detection** to classify reviews into emotional categories like *joy*, *anger*, *sadness*, etc., for more granular insights.
- 📊 **Develop a real-time dashboard** using **Streamlit** or **Flask** to monitor incoming reviews and sentiment trends dynamically.

These enhancements would provide a more powerful, accurate, and user-friendly sentiment analysis system.
